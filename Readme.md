Servant Purescript
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eskimor/servant-purescript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eskimor/servant-purescript)


Current status: It works! Documentation is yet to come, but there is a usage example in examples/central-counter which also employs a very early version of servant-subscriber
used for counter live updates. (Especially the PureScript side of servant-subscriber is very low-level and will change significantly in the future.)

For type translations purescript-bridge is used.

I now have to take care of my actual project, which makes use of servant-purescript, improvements and documentation will follow on the way!
